This is a landslide based presentation for PearlHacks 2015

Visit http://calebsmith.github.io/pearlhacks-2015/ to view the slides

These slides were used for a 2 hour workshop session. Of the roughly 60 slides,
the material for the first 40 were covered, which is just enough to introduce
.onclick of JavaScript and really nothing more. In other words, there is more
material than will really fit.

These slides could be used with little adaptation for a 3 hour workshop.
